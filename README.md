# This fork
Whatever i feel to. not planning on doing something specific but get fun learning and writing random shit. ideally i'd like to make this like the upstream repository but extended and have cooperative support but it's a lot of work for a single person so i do not like to get big hopes on it.

You are free to do whatever you want with my changes as long as you credit the list of contributors.

Almost all duplicated markdowns have been deleted and this fork will only display important changes that aren't present in the upstream. to set up, building and other resources visit the upstream repository's docs.
