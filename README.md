# Half-Life Unified SDK

This project was being developed under the branch [deprecated/limitlesspotential-sdk](https://github.com/Mikk155/halflife-unified-sdk/tree/deprecated/limitlesspotential-sdk) but i decided to move it out to a different repository for my mod [limitlesspotential-sdk](https://github.com/Mikk155/limitlesspotential-sdk) and use this instead to have a variety of branch with either bug fixes, improves or experimental features.
